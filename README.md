**Oil Spill Pattern Prediction Using Open Meteo API**

This project leverages the Open Meteo API to predict oil spill patterns based on wave and wind data. For detailed information, please refer to the [Open Meteo documentation](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs).

## Overview

The visualization below demonstrates the predicted oil spill path from the initial position to its forecasted trajectory. This prediction is based on wave patterns retrieved from Open Meteo.

Using Matplotlib and Basemap, we visualize the predicted oil spill path, providing a clearer view of potential spill patterns.

## Note

This prediction is a simplified model and does not account for additional factors such as oil type and spill volume. More complex models would be needed for a comprehensive analysis.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to help minimize marine damage caused by oil spills. By predicting the flow of oil through affected waters, we aim to facilitate prompt response actions and mitigate further harm to marine life.
