# OilSpillFlow
Oil spill pattern prediction using Open Mateo API\
For more information refer to their [documentation](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)\
The image below shows the possible oil spill pattern from the initial position to its predicted pattern after retrieving predicted wave patterns from Open Mateo.\
![Figure_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53fbba8b-8afe-4978-a6de-c5e54ad98800)
Using matplotlib and basemap we were able to visualize a clearer path for the predicted oil spill formation\
This is just a simple prediction pattern without the consideration of other factors like oil type and spill volume (more complex models)\
